                <p>&ensp;This poem of imam Al Shafi'i is a remarkable piece of literature that highlights the
                   importance of piety and God-consciousness in one's life. The poem's message resonates
                   with me, as it reminds me to constantly strive to improve my character and conduct myself in
                   a way that is pleasing to Allah. It inspires me to be mindful of my actions and to always act
                   with integrity and sincerity.</p>

                    achieved remarkable success in his career, but what sets him apart from
                    others is his incredible drive and work ethic. Musk is known for working long hours and
                    setting ambitious goals for himself and his companies. He is a risk-taker and is willing 
                    to pursue projects that others might see as impossible.He is an inspiration to many and a 
                    testament to the power of hard work and perseverance.
