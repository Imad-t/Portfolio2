                <p> &ensp;I like staying always active, they say a healthy body is a vessel for a healthy mind
                    so i try keeping fit by going to the gym at least once or twice a week and it also helps 
                    clear my mind.
                </p>
                <p>&ensp; Eventhough I'm not much of a player, I'm a huge football fan, mainly it's European
                 football, my favorite club is Barcelona lol.

                <p> &ensp;While I haven't had the luck to travel abroad yet and visit other countries, I enjoy exploring
                    the beautiful nature of Algeria, It keeps on surprising me on every trip I make.
                </p>
                <p>&ensp; On the top of my bucket list is to visit the furthest areas south of Algeria(Djanet,Tassili..)
                    and to go on trip abroad, I was thinking Eastern Europe.

                <p>&ensp; I enjoy watching a variety of movies, from action and adventure to drama and thriller. 
                    Some of my favorite movies include The Terminal, 12 Angry men, The Shawshank Redemption, and Interstellar.
                </p>
                <p>&ensp;I'm also a big fan of Tv Series and Anime.</p>

                <h2 id="r">Reading</h2>
                <p>&ensp; I can't call myself an avid reader, I like to sit alone with a book every once in while.
                </p>
                <p>&ensp;My favorite genres are Islamic religion and History</p>

                <h2 id="p">Podcasts</h2>
                <p>&ensp;Recently, I've been trying to listen to more podcasts and less music and it's been a great
                    decision so far, I get to spend the time that I usually waste on the road or in public tranportaion on
                    listening to useful pieces of information.
                </p>
                <p>&ensp;I listen to podcasts on a wide range of topics from religion to economy, health, technology,
                    politics, society and history. My favorite network is currently thamanyah.
                </p>
                <p>&ensp;I find the aspect where podcasts can top physical books is that the people we listen to 
                    have more freedome when expressing themselves and their thoughts than to write them down. However
                    one must know very well who he is listening to.
